## Other common questions I received

- Tell me about yourself, why did you apply to this company, what do you know about our company...
- What is the most difficult technical challenge you faced?
- Architecture diagram of my projects
- Projects - why did you choose XYZ framework/database/etc?

## Other tips

- Apply to as many jobs as possible within the first 2-3 weeks of the job hunt. It makes it easier to handle when you receive coding challenges, interviews, and onsites later on.
- If you are rejecting an offer, put the recruiter in touch with another developer!
- Enthusiasm is key. Showing your passion for the product, tech stack, or the company can go a long way.
- Technical skills are not the only things being assessed in an interview - people will also ask themselves (for a good reason), "Will this person be fun to work with 8-10 hours a day?"
